       <p>Hello, my name is Colton Elstrom. I am currently a student in the YearUp program studying Application Development where I am honing my skills to become an emerging professional in the tech field. My passion outside of school and work is music. I have been playing guitar for over ten years and have structured my life around it. I also have a love for camping, fishing, and really just anything in nature. In the past, I was a Scale technician where I would certify and repair broken scales which taught me how to be a critical thinker and work well with customers and groups. I did this for five years before deciding that I wanted to get into the tech industry and begin a new career path.</p>
       
       <p>Recently I bought an American Original Fender Telecaster in Lake Placid blue. It is my pride and joy, and usually what I am doing when I am not on my computer. I grew up going camping near Roslyn, Washington on the upper Cle Elum river where a little stream called Fortune Creek runs into the Cle Elum. I have too many memories here to count, my grandpa used to take my dad to the same spot when he was a kid. We would camp at the same site as they did and I plan on going back as much as I can. </p>
       
       
       <p>I was born in Renton, Washington and have lived in Maple Valley my entire life. I very much enjoy it here, and haven't visited a place that I would consider better than the Pacific Northwest. I am a big fan of listening to music as well as playing it. Some of my favorite artists are Neil Young, John Mayer, Metallica, The Beatles, .38 Special, I could keep going but this list would never end otherwise.</p>
           
      <p>My most recent accomplishment was getting a 95/100 on my IT116 midterm for HTML and CSS. I just learned coding at the beginning of this program and had zero experience before that so I feel very accomplished.
